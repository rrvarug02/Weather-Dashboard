# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This Weather Dashboard application allows the users to search for weather data by any city name. During this challenge I practiced using an API. This website provides the user with current weather information and a 5-day weather forecast using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application also saves search history in the local storage so that users can quickly access previously searched cities.

## User Usage
Enter the name of a city in the search input field and click the "Search" button. The current weather and 5-day forecast for the entered city will be displayed. Previously searched cities will appear as buttons below the search field. Clicking on a button will reload the weather data for that city.
